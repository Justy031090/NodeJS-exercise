/* 20% faster than express



Fastify provides full encapsulation for plug-ins, automatically parses JSON with relatively faster rendering, and provides quick routing. Among other benefits, Fastify also has a cleaner syntax for writing async code in controllers.

Express, however, has a stronger user base with plenty of documentation available. Express is so popular that it is ubiquitously associated with Node.js and part of the MEAN and MERN stack.

In summary, Fastify promises faster performance with low overhead, but Express is a familiar framework that many developers may be more comfortable working with.
